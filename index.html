       <p>Space is the never ending three dimensional (3d) extent in which substance exist. In space, no one can 
          hear you scream. This is because there is no air in space, it is a vacuum. Sound waves cannot travel 
          through a vacuum. Space is everything in the Universe beyond the top of the Earth's atmosphere. 
          'Outer space' begins about 100 km above the Earth, where the shell of air around our planet disappears, 
          with no air to scatter sunlight and produce a blue sky and space appears as a black blanket dotted with
          stars. The vast gaps between the stars and planets are filled with huge amounts of thinly spread gas 
          and dust. Even the emtiest parts of sapce contain at least a few hundred atoms or molecules per cubic 
          metere. Space is also filled with many forms of radiation that are dangerous to astrounauts. For 
          example, the ultraviolet radiations that comes from the Sun.</p>

           some sense of touch.</strong>

            <p>Scientists define planets as dark bodies that orbit around a star. Dark bodies are objects in 
                space that do not release enough light to be visible to the eye. We can still see the planets in 
                the night skyp becuase light from the sun reflects off them. We get the term planet from the 
                Greek word 'planetes' meaning 'wanderer'. In the 1600's scientists began to use telescopes to
                observe the Solar Syestem. As technology got better, scientists dicovered more planets orbiting
                around our Sun such as Uranus in 1781 and Neptune in 1846. IN 2006, IAU (International 
                Astronomical Union) passes the first scientific definition of a planet. According to this an 
                object must meet three criteria in order to be classified as a planet. 1. It must orbit the Sun.
                2. it must be big enough for gravity to squash into a round ball. 3. It must have cleared other 
                objects out of the way in it's orbital neighbourhood.</p>

          <p>The inner planets contain Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. The outer planets contain Jupiter, Saturn,
             Uranus and Neptune. They are seperated by astroids called 'Astroid Belt' which lies between Jupiter and 
             Mars. The inner planets are known as 'Terrestrial Planets' because they are similar to Earth in
             composition and size. They have a solid surface and are composed of heavy metals, such as nickel and 
             iron These planets tend to have few or no moons. Earth and Mars are the only inner planets that have 
             moons orbiting them. All of them do not have rings orbiting them. They spin slowly when compared to 
             outer planets which are in much larger size. It takes Earth 23 hours and 56 minutes to spin on it's 
             axis. The outer planets are the furthest planets from the Sun. They are also known as Gas Giants 
             or Jovian Planets. Most of them are made of gas. They have no solid surfaces and only liquid cores.
